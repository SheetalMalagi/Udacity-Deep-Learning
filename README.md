# Udacity-Deep-Learning
These are the projects I worked on as part of the Deep learning course on Udacity in 2019.There are 5 projects in all.


Bike Sharing project - Predict the number of bikeshare users on a day using Neural Network.
Dog Breed Classifier - Classify the  image of a dog, to identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed using Convolutional Neural Network.
TV Script generation - Project to generate a TV script by defining and training a recurrent neural network.
Face Generation - Define two adversarial networks, a generator and discriminator, and train them generate realistic faces using GANs.
Deployment of Sentiment Analysis - Build and deploy a RNN which predicts the sentiment of a user-provided movie review.
                                   Also create a  web app that uses your deployed model to get the prediction of a review.
                                   Deployment is done using AWS Sagemaker.
